ABSTRACT

Star plot is a popular technique to visualize multivariate data for which the
number of variables/dimensions are larger than three. In star plot display, the axes
represent variables and star-shaped polylines represent data points. Though star plot is
useful for few variables, it has limitations when the number of variables becomes very
large. In this project, we have explored two recently proposed techniques for extending
star plot for web-based visualization of such high-dimensional data with significantly
reduced visual clutter. First, Shifted origin star plot shifts the starting point(origin) along
the respective radii so that the low values of data point would be visible without loss of
information. Second, Multilevel star plot divides the total dimensions into multiple
levels(groups) and reduce the data for each level in a separate concentric region. As
the number of axes increases, an angle between axes decreases making it hard to
extract useful information from the plot. In Multilevel star plot, dimensions are divided
into levels such that desired angle between axes is maintained. The Focus of this
project is to implement these two methods using web techniques and demonstrate their
usefulness in a visualization of high-dimensional datasets.
